### Enhancement 3 - Databases

# This artifact is the same artifact that I used for in my previous two enhancements. It was originally a program written in Java designed for rescue animals. It allows the user to intake new rescue dogs and monkeys into the program. The user can then change the reserve status of an animal, print a list of all dogs, print a list of all monkeys, and print a list of all animals that are in-service and not reserved. The artifact was created in my IT-145 class at the beginning of 2023.
# I selected this artifact to include in my ePortfolio to showcase my skills in all three enhancement categories. I felt like this artifact was a great foundation to build upon and needed improvement. Specific components such as the usage of SQLite showcase my skills and abilities with databases and queries. In the original artifact animals are stored in memory which is not very useful in a real-world application as this solution is more appropriate for testing purposes. In this enhancement, I utilized SQLite to store the animals in a database and created various queries to improve the original functionality. For example, I created additional queries to allow the user to search for an animal by name, search for and display dogs by breed, search for and display monkeys by species, and the ability to remove an animal from the database. 
# I did meet the course outcomes that I planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. I believe this enhancement aligns with #5 of the Computer Science program outcomes: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. This enhancement mitigates the design flaws of the original artifact and enhances the security of data and resources. I have now met the third, fourth, and fifth Computer Science program outcomes that I aimed to meet in Module One. 
# While enhancing and modifying the artifact, I learned a lot about SQLite. While I have used MySQL and NoSQL in the past, I have never used SQLite before. I found it interesting to implement a solution that I have not used before, especially in conjunction with Python. I also refreshed my memory and learned how to utilize multiple types of queries together. While this enhancement works well, I did face challenges. I originally wanted to utilize MySQL to create an interface for the artifact, but I became concerned about others trying to connect to my MySQL server. I would have to share the details of my server which could become a security issue, and my computer would have to remain on with the server running for anyone else to test my program. I also ran into multiple different issues in attempting to create the interface so I thought it would be best to scrap the idea and utilize SQLite as it is easy to share the database since it is stored in a file. I also ran into some issues with the creation of my queries as I am unfamiliar with SQLite and have not written a query in some time. I was able to overcome these challenges by utilizing SQLiteâ€™s documentation on the official website.
